3. Use PropTypes and default props for components 

Comments for App.js
--------------------------

Line 3 - All CCS should be in an external .css file
Line 4 - Best to use rem unit instead of px
Line 7 - CarsFuuel is misspelled, Should be CarsFuel for lack of a better name for the component
Line 8 - User facing tet and labels should go in a translations file so we can implement localization in the future.
Line 8 - props.children should be sanitised before using to avoid unwanted effects
Line 13 - Instead of uisnng 0 & 1 for state, use an Enum or at least readable constants. In this case, it makes more sense to have sate as a boolean rather than a number.
Line 16 - Avoid using constants usch as 1200. Best to use a value provided via props. e.g. fuelThreshold = 1200
Line 19 - useEffect is missing a dpeendencies array.
Line 21 - Use ternary operator. e.g. condition ? true : false
Line22 - Avoid using inline css if possible
Line 33 - { x: 1, f: 0 } - Use readable variable names instead of x and f
Line 37 - Set time out will keep going for ever. We need logic to stop the timer
Line 39 - Extract the logic for fuel calculation in a separate function and provide comments around the logic
Line 45 - Use the lifecycle method componentWillUnmount to provide cleanup code for the timer
Lines 50 and 51 - No need to create these variables. Also use let and const instead of var
